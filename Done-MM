Things that were in ./Notes-MM and are now done
------------------------------------------------

1)  inter = FALSE  als Default
     -- call it `interactive' (can still abbreviate)
    actually now have  `dev.interactive()' which is nice, but not S+
    ==> need S+ version of dev.interactive()
	--> DONE

2b) `remakescreen' is not such a great name.
    I'd prefer  `redrawscreen' or even rather  `redrawSC'

	---> DONE;  used  redrawMatrix()

4)  return(a, b, c)  should rather be  return(list(a=a, b=b, c=c))
    This is from a statement by John Chambers ("return(a,b,c) should never
    have worked").
			--> DONE


7) MM: I found that the sign of diff-components is effectively random,
   depending on the exact numerics used in firstpcres() and hence eigen(),
   effectively. This can now give different results (diff.components
   multiplied by +/- 1) in different versions of S-PLUS or R, possibly even
   same versions on different floating point architecture (e.g. Intel-Linux
   vs Sun SPARC) or even difference only because of different compiler
   (optimizations) used for the underlying eigen decomposition routine.

   I propose to make diff.components unique, by, e.g. fixing the sign of
   the first (or last) non-zero entry to always be positive.
   Alternatively, one might ensure that correlations to previous components
   should be rather positive than negative (or vice versa).

   Leaving the diff.comp only determinated up to multiplication by +/- 1
   seems unsatisfactory to me.


    ---> DONE: we set the first non-0 entry of "zcomp" (before "shrinking")
	       to positive.

1) I indented things using Emacs and ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics)

14.12.2002:

2) The author (Valentin ?) uses 1 and 0 everywhere,
   where TRUE/FALSE should be used. This leads to superfluous code such as
   a)
      result <- 1* ( <logical expression> )
   or
   b)
      if (a == 1)    would be just  if(a)
      if (a == 0)    would be just  if(!a)

3) Computation, Printing and Plotting are all intertwined;
   this may be useful at beginning but is not flexible enough.
   These three things should be in  separate functions, where one can still
   have a `global' interactive function that calls the separate steps.

4) groupcomp() clearly only needs cor(X)
   I wonder if one couldn't work with an input cor.matrix !!
   ==> more flexibility

5) sca( "cor = 0/1" ) -- In S (S-plus and R), there's the function
   scale() which you should use here.  scale() has arguments
   center = T/F and scale = T/F.
   For consistency, you should use  scale = TRUE  here instead of "cor = 1"
